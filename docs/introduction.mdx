# React Searchable Filter

A React library which provides you the searchable filter component with lots of awesome features and can be easy-customizable.

## Features

1. **Fully Flexible:** You can use the filter component wherever you want.It won't affect other components. The filters options are completely flexible and absolute positioned
2. **User Friendly:** The component is made very user-friendly. The users will be able to use the component very easy and comfortably.
3. **Fully Managed State:** Unlike most other libraries, state of combo box is managed by the library so that you don't have to.
4. **Responsive:** The component is fully responsive. The options container will be positioned top or bottom based on the space available in the window or document.
5. **Autocomplete:** The user can be able to search in the input and the options are filtered based on the text in the input.
6. **Keyboard Accessible:** The filter component also supports the Keyboard accessibility. You can access the options through the keyboard also.

## Motivation

In most of the projects, we will require the filter component to filter the data. So I think of building the filter component along with search option which will be useful.
